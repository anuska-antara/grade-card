# grade-card-generator

This project is a simple Grade Card Generator for students implemented in C programming language. It takes student details as input along with their marks obtained in three subjects in three different exams - ISA 1, ISA 2, and ESA. It provides functionality to print the results (total marks obtained by the student) separately in a tabular format along with student information. Additionally, it offers an option to calculate the grade obtained by students and print the grade card containing the grades obtained by students collectively in ISA 1, ISA 2, and ESA.
